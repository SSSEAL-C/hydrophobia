    <td><pre><code>~/Library/Application Support/minecraft/saves</code></pre></td>
    <td><pre><code>~/.minecraft/saves</code></pre></td>

Locate your world file (usually your worlds name, unless you have renamed it) by opening the directory above.
  
Once you are in your worlds directory, open the `datapacks` folder and place the zip file (`snail.zip`) inside.

Once installed, on the loading of the world, any player in survival or adventure mode will get hurt by rain and water.
